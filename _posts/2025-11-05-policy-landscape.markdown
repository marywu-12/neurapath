Efforts to improve healthcare [price transparency](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/key-initiatives/hospital-price-transparency/accuracy-and-completeness-rfi) and promote [shared decision making](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/strategic-direction) have gained momentum as part of CMS’s broader push towards patient-centered care. CMS aims to empower patients, especially [older adults](https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/age-friendly-health-systems) and those with chronic conditions, to make informed choices about their care. Tools such as NeuraPath will build on these policies by prioritizing consumer and patient insights, helping users navigate the healthcare system with confidence and clarity. 

## Price Transparency
NeuraPath is a tool designed to connect individuals with care options that fit their clinical, financial and personal needs. By integrating price data and provider quality metrics, NeuraPath aims to simplify the decision making process for caregivers and older adults. Its platform helps users compare costs, understand expected out of pocket expenses, and identify providers who deliver fitting, high quality, age-friendly care. This approach is in line with [current federal mandates](https://www.cms.gov/healthplan-price-transparency) that support price transparency and real world applicability.

## Advancing Consumer/Patient Empowerment 
NeuraPath also seeks to advance health equity and shared decision making initiatives, by ensuring that underserved populations like older adults and their caregivers can access clear, comprehensible healthcare information, empowering them to take a bigger stake in leveraging their own care. When caregivers and older adults understand their care options and costs, they are better equipped to advocate for themselves and their long-term care needs. This aligns with CMS’s vision for equitable, value-based healthcare that prioritizes trust, transparency and patient-centered outcomes. 

## Looking Forward
As CMS continues to refine transparency regulations, tools like NeuraPath will play a vital role in bringing transparent, dependable, informative care to everyday users. The future of patient-centered care will depend not only on data availability, but on how effectively that data is translated into decision support. Strengthening that bond between consumer and healthcare is integral in ensuring the integrity and quality of care and prioritizing their intended impact: informed, confident and connected patients.
